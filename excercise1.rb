# Define a method called double that accepts an argument called my_number and returns that number multiplied by 2.

# Try calling it multiple times and pass in different numbers each time.
# in this situation you will have to define it as double and renaming it
#my number using open and close blackets "()", now my_number is just as double
# so when you choose a number for double it is same as my_number and you can multiply
#that by 2 as stated by the question and terminal will print the answer.

def double (my_number)
  puts my_number * 2
end

double(4)
