#Define a method called negative? that accepts a number as an argument and
#returns a boolean (true/false) indicating whether that number is negative or not.
#Try calling it multiple times, passing in different numbers each time.

def negetive?(number) #the arguement number is whats in the bracket and it represents that negetive? accepts number
  puts number < 0    #rememeber you want the booleans true to be written when you have a - number and a number less than 0
end                   # remember  to end your work

negetive?(-3)         # if we want the negetive number to indicate true then make sure your you choose a number lessthan (<) 0.

# now therefore if the number you choose for negetive? is greater (>) 0 then it will return false since its positive but if its less than 0 then it will print true because that is negetive.

#now run this via terminal with ruby.
